Event handling in JS and parsing forms

I created this project as a my own solution for event handling and form parsing.
During my work I didn't like to have a lot event listeners or large switch cases. Also,
since I worked with lots of forms I wanted to exclude some logic which would give me as
clean data as I could have.
